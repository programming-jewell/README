Coding help needed.

I have written a program that consists of two arrays with the same integers in them.
They have to be sorted using different sorting methods, one bubble and the other selection.
I have completed this and my code displays the array contents both, before and after, they are arranged.
Does anyone know how to code it so that my program will also display each swap made from start to finish?
I am using C++ and any help is greatly appriciated!!
